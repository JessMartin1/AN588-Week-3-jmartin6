# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Background Information**</span> 

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Question #1: What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?**</span>

```{R, Question #1}
x <- 15 #Define the mean number of calls

probability_less_than_8 <- ppois(8, x) #Calculate the probability of hearing 8 or fewer calls

probability_more_than_8 <- 1 - probability_less_than_8 #Calculate the probability of hearing more than 8 calls

cat("Probability of hearing more than 8 calls", probability_more_than_8) #Result
```
# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Question #2: What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?**</span>

```{R, Question #2}

x <- 15 #Define the mean number of calls

probability_no_calls <- ppois(0, x) #Calculate the probability of hearing no calls

cat("Probability of hearing no calls in a session", probability_no_calls) #Result
```
# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Question #3: What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?**</span>

```{R, Question #3}
x <- 15 #Define the mean number of calls

probability_3_calls <- dpois(3, x) #Calculate the probability of hearing exactly 3 calls

cat("Probability of hearing exactly 3 calls in a session", probability_3_calls) #Result
```
# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Question #4: Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.**</span>

```{R, Question #4}
x <- 0:30 #Assign values in the range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 30 to the variable x
l = 15 #Define lambda
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l) #Create variable to calculate using dpois
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = "Poisson Mass Function") #Resulting plot
```

# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Question #5: Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).**</span>

```{R, Question #5}
simulated_results <- rpois(n = 104, lambda = 15)
```

# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Question #6: Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above.**</span>

```{R, Question #6}
hist(simulated_results, xlim = c(0, 30), breaks = seq (0:30),
     main = "Simulated 104 Results (2 Years of Saturday Monitoring Sessions)",
     xlab = "Number of Titi Monkey Calls in a 2 Hour Window (x)",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "darkcyan",
     border = "darkgreen")

```

# <span style="font-size:12pt;">**Challenges I Faced For Homework 2**</span>

1. I struggled with alignment during this homework assignment. That was until Sam showed me how to center align my image, and Bhavya showed me how to left align my text. Functions to do this are in the Rmd file.
2. I was not completely sure about what the ppois() and dpois() functions were, and when/why you should use them. This [website](https://rpubs.com/eyadalkronz/837816) helped me.
3. I was initially unsure how to approach question #5 and did not know how to go about answering it. I referred back to the above website and learned about the rpois() function. It did work, yet I'm not sure if it is correct.
4. I struggled to pick a titi monkey image. So many cute ones, so hard to decide!
5. I often forget to include annotations as I write my code. I need to get better about this.
